- **Punjab Cities Coverage**: Monitors 6 major cities (Ludhiana, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Jalandhar, Patiala, Bathinda)
- **Intelligent Alert Detection**: Automatically detects dangerous weather conditions:
  - Heat waves (>40¬∞C, low humidity)
  - Cold waves (<4¬∞C, wind chill)
  - Heavy rainfall (>50mm/24h, >100mm/48h)
  - Dust storms (wind >40 km/h, low visibility)
  - Thunderstorms and hail
  - Visibility issues (fog, smog)
- **External API Integration**: Uses OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data
